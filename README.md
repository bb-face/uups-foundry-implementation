## Test answer

### Use Solidity version ^0.8.0 (please pick a version and explain why you used it).

I selected Solidity version ^0.8.20 for its introduction of overflow and underflow checks, custom errors and compatibility with OpenZeppelin version 5. Newer versions carry the risk of potential new bugs/exploits. Since subsequent updates haven't offered significant new features essential to my project ^0.8.20 feels like a good balance between security and stability.
